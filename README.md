# ThreeJS-Workshop - README

## Description

This is a Training | ThreeJS app named "ThreeJS-Workshop". It was developed to learn and practice the basics of ThreeJS and React Three Fiber (R3F). 
The app was created using a tutorial from rithmic: 
[ThreeJS Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTfMjI4rVSI).

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. In this project, React is used to manage the component structure and interactive elements of the application.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server. Vite is used for efficient building and development of the app.
- **ThreeJS**: A JavaScript library for creating and displaying 3D graphics in the browser. ThreeJS is the core of this app and is used for the 3D rendering logic.
- **React Three Fiber (R3F)**: A React renderer for ThreeJS. R3F allows integration and management of ThreeJS scenes within React components.
- **Drei**: A helper library for React Three Fiber that provides useful components and abstractions for working with ThreeJS. Drei is used to simplify and optimize the development process by offering commonly used functionalities.


## App Functionalities

- 3D rendering and interaction through the combination of ThreeJS and React Three Fiber.
- Utilization of the Drei helper library for simplification and optimization of development.
- Learning and training environment for the basics of ThreeJS and React Three Fiber.


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
